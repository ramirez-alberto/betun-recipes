<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A tamale is a traditional Mesoamerican dish, made of masa, a dough made from
    nixtamalized corn, which is steamed in a corn husk or banana leaf.
    The wrapping can either be discarded prior to eating or used as a plate.
    Tamales can be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, herbs, chilies,
    or any preparation according to taste, and both the filling and the cooking
    liquid may be seasoned.</p>
<p>Tamale is an anglicized version of the Spanish word tamal (plural: tamales).
    Tamal comes from the Nahuatl tamalli. The English "tamale" is a back-formation
    of tamales, with English speakers interpreting the -e- as part of the stem,
    rather than part of the plural suffix -es.</p>
